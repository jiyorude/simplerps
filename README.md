<h4 align="center">Simple JavaScript Rock, Paper, Scissors Game.</h4>

The core of this game was based and inspired on the assignment found in the excellent JavaScript course provided by Dave Gray. This version of the game is based on the first assignment, where a RPS game was made based on JavaScript alerts. simpleRPS adds a couple of QoL-improvements to the table, such as:

- Custom, flex-based front-end
- Bootstrap Modals replace JavaScript alerts
- Modals contain appropriate buttons to play; no typing required.
- Various CSS animations
- JavaScript code adjustments and general improvements
